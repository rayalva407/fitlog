## 1. Project Overview & Objectives

**Vision:** My vision is to create an intuitive and visually appealing cross-platform mobile application that provides a tool for individuals to stay consistent with their fitness and wellness goals.

**Primary Objective:** Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) that demonstrates core functionality for a fitness and habit-tracking application.

**Success Criteria:**
*   A fully functional application that can be tested on iOS and Android (and maybe web), and be deployed.
*   Core features (Habit Tracking, Workout Logging, Data Persistence) are implemented and bug-free.
*   The app features an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
*   The project is completed within 8 weeks as a solo developer.

## 3. Scope

### In-Scope (MVP Features):
*   **User Authentication:** User can create an account and log in securely.
*   **Habit Tracking:** Create, edit, delete, and mark habits as complete. View streak counters.
*   **Workout Logging:** Create, edit, delete, and log workouts. View workout history.
*   **Dashboard:** A main screen providing a summary of today's habits and recent workout activity.
*   **Data Persistence:** User data must be saved and persist between app sessions.
*   **Responsive UI:** A clean, modern UI that works on various phone screen sizes.

### Out-of-Scope (For Future Versions):
*   Social features (sharing, friends, competitions).
*   Advanced statistics and complex data visualization.
*   Pre-loaded exercise libraries with animations.
*   Syncing data across multiple devices.
*   Payment processing or premium features.
*   Push notifications (stretch goal).

## 4. High-Level Functional Requirements

1.  The application will allow a user to register and log in.
2.  The application will allow a user to create a new habit with a name.
3.  The application will display a list of the user's habits.
4.  The application will allow a user to mark a habit as "complete" for the current day.
5.  The application will calculate and display a streak counter for each habit.
6.  The application will allow a user to create a workout routine with a name.
7.  The application will allow a user to log a completed instance of a workout.
8.  The application will display a history of logged workouts.
9.  The application will persist all user data.

## 5. Technical Stack & Tools

*   **Framework:** React Native using Expo
*   **Language:** JavaScript / TypeScript
*   **Navigation:** React Navigation
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
*   **UI Styling:** NativeWind
*   **Persistence:** Firebase Firestore & Authentication
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
*   **Project Management:** Trello or GitHub Projects
*   **Deployment:** Expo Application Services (EAS)

## 6. High-Level Timeline & Milestones

| Phase | Key Activities | Estimated Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 2: Design** | Create wireframes, finalize UI design, define data models. | 1 Week |
| **Phase 3: Development - Sprint 1** | Project setup, navigation, authentication, habit CRUD. | 2 Weeks |
| **Phase 3: Development - Sprint 2** | Workout CRUD, dashboard, connecting to state & persistence. | 2 Weeks |
| **Phase 4 & 5: Test & Polish** | Usability testing, bug fixing, performance tuning. | 2 Weeks |
| **Phase 6: Deployment** | Building with EAS, preparing demo link. | 1 Week |
| | **Total** | **8 Weeks** |

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

**Risks:**
*   **Scope Creep:** Adding features beyond the MVP.
    *   *Mitigation: Strictly adhere to the "Out-of-Scope" list.*
*   **Time Management:** Balancing project work with other commitments.
    *   *Mitigation: Follow the timeline and break tasks into small chunks.*

**Assumptions:**
*   I have sufficient knowledge of React and JavaScript to begin.
*   Expo provides a stable enough environment for the required features.
*   The project does not require real-time multi-user functionality.
